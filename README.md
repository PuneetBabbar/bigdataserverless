Big Data serverless application

This will provide you an overview of a serverless big data application, this implemented is on the serverless rail hosted on AWS cloud. 

This application is a **log aggregator** application and works in the _lambda architecture_, so we have both real-time and batch pipeline processing are being done simultaneously on the same data source.  

With the Lambda architecture, it enables to have both real-time analytics like fraud detection, or site/node failure etc and it also provides the insight from the historic load like log analysis etc. Follow the implementaiton step on this [link](https://github.com/PuneetBabbar/bigdataserverless/blob/master/Implement.md).
